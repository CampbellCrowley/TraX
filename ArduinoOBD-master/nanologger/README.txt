This is the source code for the Arduino OBD-II data logger, which displays (on a 128x64 OLED display module) and records (to a SD card) a selected set of OBD-II data.

The recorded data is stored in CSV format and the file can be illustrated into a graphic chart by a free service at:

To compile the code with Arduino IDE, please copy all library files from the libraries directory to Arduino's libraries directory.

To open the project file (cbp), please download CodeBlocks Arduino Edition (http://arduinodev.com/codeblocks).

The source code is distributed under GPL license.
